# cv
My real CV created using my Jekyll theme [academic-cv-jekyll](https://github.com/dimpram/academic-cv-jekyll) as a class assignment for [sw](https://github.com/courses-ionio/sw) university course.

It also uses a github action to produce a pdf from a latex file that sources the same details.yml as the web version.
